This explains only on Mac environment.
When developing Chrome plugin.
each Plugin can refer only the files inside the folder.
so, If there are several project like below(`sample`, `tabswitcher-master`), I had to copy and past the utility javascript file to each project's folder. but I would like to use same files in `util` folder

Then, how can we use just same file from several projects?
I solved by hard link from Linux.

{% highlight bash %}

ln ./util/Preference.js ./<project-name>/util/Preference.js
ln ./util/Tabs.js ./<project-name>/util/Tabs.js
{% endhighlight %}
