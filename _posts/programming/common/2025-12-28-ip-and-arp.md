# IP Analysis

## Tools and Commands

### Check Your IP
- [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/)
- [whois.com](http://www.whois.com)

### Find IP from Domain Name
```bash
nslookup google.com
```
Note: Some domains may not be found with nslookup. Use Google Network Analysis Tool to check remote address.

### Find Domain Name from IP
```bash
nslookup 13.234.100.208
```

### Check Domain Registration Information
- Use [whois.com](https://www.whois.com) to check registrant information

# ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Protocol used to find which MAC address corresponds to a given IP address within a network.

## Key Points
- Devices can only communicate using MAC addresses
- ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses

## Check ARP Table
```bash
arp -a
```
This shows the stored IP-to-MAC address mappings.

## Security Considerations
- ARP is vulnerable to MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks
- ARP spoofing can redirect traffic through an attacker's machine
