# Agile Methodology

## Definition

A methodology that finds a compromise between development without planning and development with too much planning.

**Agile** = Quick, creating good things quickly and without waste = Maximum efficiency

## Difference from Waterfall and Spiral Models

- Less document-oriented
- Code-oriented

Unlike past methodologies driven by planning, Agile is an **adaptive style** that continuously creates prototypes at **regular intervals** to reflect **changing requirements**.

This adaptability is achieved through object-oriented principles.

# Types of Agile (Can be combined)

## 1. Extreme Programming (XP)

### Core Practice: TDD (Test-Driven Development)

### Implementation Methods
- Set plans and create prototypes every 2 weeks
- Periodically confirm with clients or users if going in the right direction
- Simple coding: Follows the KISS principle
- Test before coding
- Pair Programming: One person codes, one does QA, or code together then test

---

## 2. Scrum

- Centered on **Sprint**: Provide working product every 30 days

---

## 3. Crystal Family

- Provides various methodologies based on project size and impact
- **Crystal Clear**: Methodology for the smallest teams

---

## 4. Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

- Closely related to UML-based design techniques
- Iterative development every 2 weeks per feature

---

## 5. Adaptive Software Development

- Development methodology where users or customers participate in design
- Defines software development as chaos itself
- Proposes software development methods that can adapt to chaos

---

## 6. Extreme Modeling

- Modeling-centered methodology using UML
- Continuously create models that can be executed and verified
- Ultimately, automatically generate products from models
