### Ta Marbuta (ة)

The feminine ending, pronounced as 't' or 'h' depending on context.

### Alif Maqsura (ى)

## Grammar Basics

### Case Endings

Arabic nouns change their ending based on grammatical case:

- **Nominative (Subject)**: -u ending
- **Accusative (Object)**: -a ending
- **Genitive (Possessive)**: -i ending

### Definite vs Indefinite

- **Indefinite**: Add 'n' sound (tanwin) to case ending
  - قلم (qalam - pen) -> قلمٌ (qalamun - a pen, nominative)
- **Definite**: Add الـ (al-) prefix
  - قلم (qalam) -> القلم (al-qalamu - the pen)

### Gender

- **Masculine**: Basic form (e.g., مدرّس - mudarris - male teacher)
- **Feminine**: Usually adds ة (ta marbuta) (e.g., مدرّسة - mudarrisa - female teacher)

## Prepositions

All prepositions in Arabic require the following noun to be in genitive case:

Example: بِخَير (bi-khayr)
- بِ (bi) = "with/by"
- خَير (khayr) = "good/peace"
- Combined meaning: "with peace" or "well"

## Memorization Tips

2. **ت (ta)** - Has **t**wo dots above
3. **ث (tha)** - Has **th**ree dots above
4. **ج (jim)** - Z-shaped, dot below

6. **ش (shin)** - Sin with three dots = **sh**
7. **ف (fa)** - Has one dot
8. **ق (qaf)** - Has two dots (one more than fa)
9. **ك (kaf)** - Has a curvy shape like writing K
10. **ل (lam)** - Opposite of L shape
