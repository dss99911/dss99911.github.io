Building vocabulary is essential for Korean fluency. This guide covers compound verbs, Sino-Korean words, and organizes basic vocabulary in a way that helps with verb conjugation.

## Compound Verbs (합성 동사)

Korean often combines two verbs to create new meanings. Understanding these combinations helps you grasp nuances in communication.

### 물어보다 (Try to Ask)

**하나 물어볼게요.** (Let me ask you one thing.)

- 묻다 (ask) + 보다 (see) = 물어보다
- Meaning: ask to see/understand
- The 보다 adds a sense of "trying" or "testing"
- Conjugation: 묻다 → 물어 (dim vowel changes ㄷ to ㄹ)

**Note:** Adding ~보다 to verbs often means "try to do":
- 해보다 (try to do)
- 먹어보다 (try to eat)
- 입어보다 (try on clothes)

### 받아주다 (Accept/Receive as a Favor)

**선물을 받아주세요.** (Please accept this gift.)

- 받다 (receive) + 주다 (give) = 받아주다
- From the giver's perspective, they don't know if the receiver wants to accept
- So they say "give (me the favor) of receiving"
- Conjugation: 받다 → 받아 (bright vowel)

**Note:** Adding ~주다 to verbs adds the nuance of doing something as a favor:
- 도와주다 (help - do the favor of helping)
- 기다려주다 (wait - do the favor of waiting)

## Sino-Korean Words (한자어)

Many Korean words come from Chinese characters. Understanding the character components helps memorize vocabulary.

### Word Formation Pattern

| Korean Word | Character Breakdown | Meaning |
|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| 신문 | 신 (新/new) + 문 (文/writings) | Newspaper |
| 문장 | 문 (文/writings) + 장 (章/chapter/sentence) | Sentence |

Learning the meaning of common Chinese character components helps you understand and remember new words.

### Common Character Meanings

| Character | Korean Sound | Meaning | Example Words |
|-----------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 新 | 신 | new | 신문 (newspaper), 신년 (new year) |
| 文 | 문 | writing, literature | 문장 (sentence), 문학 (literature) |
| 學 | 학 | study, learning | 학교 (school), 학생 (student) |
| 人 | 인 | person | 인간 (human), 인생 (life) |

## Memorization Tips (단어 쉽게 외우기)

Create memorable associations to learn vocabulary faster.

### Example: 건강 (Health)

- **건** = strong (If you have a gun, it's strong, right?)
- **강** = strong (from 강하다, meaning "to be strong")

While 강 technically means "comfortable" in 건강, the character 강 also appears in 강하다 (strong), which is more commonly used. So remember it as "strong + strong = health."

## Basic Vocabulary by Vowel Type

Organizing vocabulary by vowel type helps with conjugation since bright vowels use 아 and dim vowels use 어.

### Nouns

| Korean | English |
|--------|---------|
| 무엇, 뭐 | what |
| 멋 | niceness, style |
| 맛 | taste |
| 재미 | fun |

### Bright Vowel Verbs (use 아 for conjugation)

| Korean | English | Conjugated (~요) |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| 하다 | do | 해요 |
| 알다 | know | 알아요 |
| 받다 | receive | 받아요 |
| 보다 | see | 봐요 |
| 가다 | go | 가요 |
| 오다 | come | 와요 |
| 자다 | sleep | 자요 |
| 사다 | buy | 사요 |
| 날다 | fly | 날아요 |

**Related vocabulary:**
- 나비 = butterfly (something that flies - 날다)

### Dim Vowel Verbs (use 어 for conjugation)

| Korean | English | Conjugated (~요) |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| 주다 | give | 줘요 |
| 묻다 | ask | 물어요 (irregular ㄷ→ㄹ) |
| 걷다 | walk | 걸어요 (irregular ㄷ→ㄹ) |
| 두다 | put | 둬요 |

### Neutral Vowel Verbs (use 어 for conjugation)

| Korean | English | Conjugated (~요) |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| 있다 | be, exist | 있어요 |

## Passive Verbs (피동사)

Korean passive verbs are formed by adding suffixes like 이, 기, 리, 히 to verb stems.

### Common Pattern: 이기리히

These four syllables represent the passive suffixes:
- 이
- 기
- 리
- 히

### Example: 걸리다 (Take time)

**20분 걸려요.** (It takes 20 minutes.)

- From 걸다 (to hang) + 리 → 걸리다
- When something "hangs" on you, it takes your time
